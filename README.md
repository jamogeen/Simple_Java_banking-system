# Simple_Java_banking-system
This was my personal project when I was just getting started with java programming from scratch. The project contain the UI, Backend and SQL database export file.
If you want to check the project out, i uploaded the project as .rar, youcan then unzip it and import it to your preffered IDE, for my case i used NetBeans.
